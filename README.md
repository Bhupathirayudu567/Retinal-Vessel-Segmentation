# 🏥 Retinal Vessel Segmentation using U-Net in TensorFlow

This project implements **Retinal Vessel Segmentation** using the **U-Net architecture** in TensorFlow. It is designed to detect and segment blood vessels from retinal images, aiding in the diagnosis of diseases like **diabetic retinopathy** and **hypertension**.

## 📌 Dataset
The model is trained on the **DRIVE dataset**:
- [Download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zionfuo/drive2004)
- The dataset consists of **40 retinal images** (20 training + 20 testing) along with **manual annotations**.
